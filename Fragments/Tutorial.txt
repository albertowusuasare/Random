This document serves to introduce fragments to interested parties.

The documents will be useful to you if :

i) You are familiar to the android environment and have a basic
   workng knowledge of android 
ii) You are familiar with 'Activities'
ii) You have some working knowlege of Java

Introduction:
-------------------------------

	Fragments are utilities that provide programmers(you) a means of having  dynamic layouts during the execution 
of our mobile application. With fragments we are able to display layouts that can perform a variety of 
functions like getting user input, displaying cool animations and so forth.The discussion of fragments is especially 
interesting because it normally introduces a follow up question of "so how are these things you are calling fragments 
any different from activities"? 
       The following text attempts to explain more carefully the motivations for having a fragments while 
discussing the various similarities and differences between fragments and activities. Hence by the end of the
text you should have a fair idea of how the answer to, "so how are these things you are calling fragments 
any different from activities"? and you should be able to identify situations where fragments are needed. 
I also hope that you will be able to implement fragments or at least be motivated to go out and read more about them.

What the heck are fragments?
-------------------------------

According to http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html:

"A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity."


   I find the statement above to be very critical to our understanfing of framents because it provides a clear 
definition of what fragments are not, which is that : fragments are not Activities; fragments are found in 
activities and may represent some specific behavior in an Activity. This of course implies that in talking about 
fragments we are inherently talking about activities too. 

Can you see the distinction? ...

Thus a fragment is simply some way of defining how the entire user interface or even parts of the user interface of 
an activity should look at any particular point in time.

When you think of fragments just think of "LOOK", "LAYOUT", "PORTION" (I couldn't find a nicer 'L' word so "PORTION" 
works too?). It is basically a look/layout we give dynamically to a portion of an activity user interface  throughout 
different stages of the execution of our application.

Hmm I kinda see it but ... (Ok I will interrupt your thought here!)

(I should be nice! Ok go on..)

... What do I say if my 80 year old grandfather asks me about fragments?

I would say a fragment is like the skin coloration observed in  chameleons.Though the we may have same chameleon, Archaius tigris, 
we realise that at different points in its day to day life, Archaius tigris  can take on a new look. 
This new look is interesting because it also sheds some light on the kind of reaction that caused the new look in the first place.

I know your grandfather is smart but hmm I dont know about mine... I would go ahead and say, " so granny,
the chamaleon here is the activity, the different skin colorations are the different fragments associated with 
the activity and the stimulus( the thing that caused the reaction) are the things that we as programmers set in place
in our programs to produce the expected behaviors of producing fragments in an activity."


----------------------------------
How do I use a fragment in my app?
----------------------------------

First I think it will be handy to understand the fragment life cycle.

Life what..?

Ok check out the page below:

http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html
Scroll down that page; it is the chart imgage to the right. (Study it, know it, love it.) 

To start create a new Android Application project and select a blank activity.

1. In the src folder, create a new class, here we call it SampleFragment
2. After the class is created make sure that the class extends Fragments
   -> you may have to import fragments. If you want to ensure backwards compactibility with older android devices then you will have
      to select android.support.v4.Fragment if your target devices are running API 11 and above go ahead and use: android.app.Fragment


3. Now we are going to create the UI for our fragment
   create a new  Android XML file in your res/layout folder.
   Here you can design the layouts in any way you want.


4. Now we have to add the fragments to the coresponding activty
