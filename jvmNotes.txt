1. What is Java?
=====================

Emerging infrastructure and the creation of new devices and technologies and
the interconnection of these networks demandd a new environments for software.

We had all sorts of devices with microprocessors in them. Some of these were 
the growing personal computers, and devices with specific functionalities 
Television, VCR's and audio components, fax etc.

Each of these new environment possed new challenges for software developers.

Java was desinged to meet the needs of such growing networks. Platform
indepenedent architectures were even more and more needed.

The major demand for something like Java therefore was as a result of  
the growth of networks. We at that time had these huge networks of all sorts 
of devices with different architectures, operating systems and unlike programs 
that were made to compile for specific hardware and operating systems.
Platform indepenedent programs were needed because they would reduce the 
 cost of development and maintainance.


Another advantage for Java was its security over networks. Every program that 
that is downloaded on a network will be scrutinized and checked for security
unlike other programs.

Also bugs like memeory corruptions will never occur in Java because the proper
security measures were put in place.

Also java provides us a better way to software distibution. We can literally now
distributed as byte code across networks which is earier and chepater than 
programs that 



Java was created by James Arthur Gosling


2. What is JVM
===================

When we do anything in Java, we are tapping into one of the following:
1. The core programming language 
2. The class file format
3. The JVM 
4. The Java API

Prior to Java languages like C or C++ we mostly comiled and linked code into a single binary execuable file that is specific to a specific platform  into a
binary executable file specific to  a partiular hardware platform and
operating system. This was difficult because we had to trasnfer the actuall 
source files from one computer to the other and it was a difficult scheme
now that networks were growing.

We basically writes some stuff into an editor, compile what we wrote into a 
class file and then run the class file on the JVM to actually run the 
program.


A JVM is an abstract machine that interpretes bytescode and exectues a java 
program. Its main job is to load class files and execute the bytecode 
contained in those files.



Basically the idea is:

i) Write java program.
ii) Compile the program turning in into bytecode/ .class files (javac)
iii) Send all the class files to the JVM machine.
iv) The machine adds in the class files for the various Java API's
v) Turn all the bytecodes to machine specific code and then execute the program
