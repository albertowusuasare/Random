This repository contains off the hat ideas or abrupt tests that I do once in a while. 
I also include some short projects and tasks on here.

The repository so far has some work on:

1. Exploring semaphores in C
2. Exploring fragments in Android.
   -> Tutorial.txt is an interesting one. I need your feedback.. :)

3. Android Xml tutorials
