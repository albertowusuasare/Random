1. What is OpenGl?  : Pre Open Gl, Importance, what did it change
===================================================================

OpenGl simply put is  a software interface to graphics hardware. It is known 
to be highly portable and it is the most widly used API in the graphics industry.

It is important to note that OpenGl is not a programming language. 
It is a rather a libray whose functions can be called in programs.

OpenGL is used in CAD engineering, modelling programs and 3D graphics with 
consumer and business applications.

OpenGl works as follows:
----------------------

OpenGl is a procedural library. That is the programmer calls functions after functions
to achieve a certain appearance or effect.  Such commands are used to draw primitives
such as points, lines and polygons in 2D or 3D.

The operating system supplies its own API used to create graphics. For example
in Windows this API is the Graphical Device  Interface (GDI). The interfaces allow
us to draw 2D lines, points and so on. 

For a software implementation of OpenGl, OpenGL receives requests from an application
and contructs the image. The OpenGl functions call the underlying implmenatation
of the respective call in the Graphics interface of the OS and the image are displayed
on the monitor.


For a hardware implementation of OpenGl, a driver serves as the underlying interface.
Requests are not forwarded to some software API from the OS (such as the GDI),
rather such hardware drivers interfaces directly with the graphics display 
hardware.

Note that the hardware implementations far outperform software-only implementation


Advantages 
------------
* Easy porting : It is easier to port OpenGl code from one platform to another. 
  For example, openGl defines its own data types.
* Platform independence : The API does not provide functions that are closely
    	   		  tied to the duties of the operating system.For instance
			  window management is never done through OpenGl API calls.
			  The enables the a platform independent abstraction
			  of the graphics hardware.
* Scalable : OpenGL API applications can run on systems of varying sizes and 
             computing power.
* Well documented
3. Keywords
===========

Render : To turn some geometric description into an image on a screen
Pipeline : Process it takes to render images on the display
